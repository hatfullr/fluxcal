      I came up with a better way to find the "last particle" in odeint.
      Now that it is implemented, the "last particle" ID number in the
      int_at_all_pos_0000.dat file will be different. I double-checked
      the output to make sure that NONE of the changes I made affected
      the final output files, EXCEPT for the change to "last particle".
