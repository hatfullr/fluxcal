      Re-ran this directory after removing the rossonly code. I noticed
      that this directory had been all run with rossonly=.false., which
      was the incorrect setting. I updated this and re-ran the directory.

      Completely revamped the test suite. Now testing is more
      comprehensive.

      I found a way to mostly handle integrating through empty space.
      This made the int_at_all_pos files differ and also the teffs files
      differ by a very small amount. This makes sense, so it is time to
      replace the original files again.

      I came up with a better way to find the "last particle" in odeint.
      Now that it is implemented, the "last particle" ID number in the
      int_at_all_pos_0000.dat file will be different. I double-checked
      the output to make sure that NONE of the changes I made affected
      the final output files, EXCEPT for the change to "last particle".
