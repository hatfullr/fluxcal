Here, we are trying to fix the low T opacities bug.

When I force the code to use nothing but unsmoothed, unextrapolated, low T
opacities in getOpacity, the bug still persists. Thus, the bug has nothing to do
with smoothing nor with extrapolation.

Inside of getOpacity, we call the cop subroutine. Therefore, it must be that the
bug exists inside of the cop subroutine.

To be extra sure, I will use the cop subroutine directly as we write the file
from opacityTables.f.

Using the cop subroutine directly, I see the bug disappear, I think.
